# automatic_carwiper_sensor
Todayâ€™s car wipers are manual systems that work on the principle of manual switching.
So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on detecting rain and stops when rain stops.
Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system having no need for manual intervention.
